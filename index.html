                <p>The OurMods project seeked to preserve the rich history of Minecraft Modding. Be it mods, plugins,
                    server administration tools, mod loaders, world modification tools, game maps and beyond. We didn't
                    seek to serve strictly as a "mod host", but as an archive of the mod content that makes Minecraft so
                    unique and versatile.</p>

                <h3>
                    <a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span
                            class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

                <p>Mod Authors relied on a connection to sources like Dropbox and Mediafire. When these companies eventually 
                    decide to change how they operate and links start going down. The mod will become unplayable and unable 
                    to be enjoyed by future generations. By archiving these mod files, along with additional community 
                    generated content. The lost content will then be available to play long aftertheir developers have 
                    abandoned them.</p>

                <p>Our Mods has shut down, but our legacy stil exists. If you'd like to assist in the archival process,
                    please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm">MCArchive</a> Discord Server</p>

                <p>MCArchive really appreciates help finding legitimate files for mods and plugins that are no longer
                    available due to dead links, thread closings, Fandom's Minecraft Forge Purge, Dropbox Public
                    Folders, etc. If you find any such files, MCArchive will love to hear about it.</p>
